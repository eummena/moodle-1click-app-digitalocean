Link-opening methods are: app (for linking to an activity supported by the app), inappbrowser (for opening a link in a browser without leaving the app), browser (for opening the link in the device default browser outside the app) and embedded (for displaying the link in an iframe in a new page in the app).

When items are missing a translation for a given language, they will use other languages as fallback unless "_only" is appended to the language code.
