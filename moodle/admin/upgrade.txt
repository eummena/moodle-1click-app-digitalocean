This files describes API changes in /admin/*.

=== 3.9 ===

* The following functions, previously used (exclusively) by upgrade steps are not available anymore because of the upgrade cleanup performed for this version. See MDL-65809 for more info:
    - upgrade_fix_block_instance_configuration()
    - upgrade_theme_is_from_family()
    - upgrade_find_theme_location()
    - linkcoursesectionsupgradescriptwasrun setting
    - upgrade_block_positions()

=== 3.8 ===

* Admin setting "Open to Google" (opentogoogle) has been renamed to the more generic "Open to search engines" (opentowebcrawlers).
  This is a more accurate representation of what is being set and the config string has also been moved and updated to reflect this.

=== 3.7 ===

* Admin setting "Allow blocks to use the dock" (allowblockstodock) has been removed & stings deprecated.
  Docking of blocks is no longer supported within the core themes (Boost, Classic).
  Please see MDL-64506 for further details.

=== 3.3 ===

* The admin settings admin_setting_configselect and admin_setting_configmultiselect now support the optgroup tag.
  Grouping of options can be created with this new tag.
  For using it, the option parameters needs the Group names as indexes:
  [
    "Spain" =>  ["madrid" => "Madrid", "barcelona" => "Barcelona"],
    "France" => ["paris" => "Paris", "marseille" => "Marseille"],
  ]

=== 3.2 ===

* Admin settings have been refined to better support right-to-left languages. In RTL,
  most fields should not have their direction flipped, a URL, a path to a file, ...
  are always displayed LTR. The admin setting will now best guess if they should be
  RTLized based on their PARAM_* type. To override that guess, use
  admin_setting::set_force_ltr(true/false).
