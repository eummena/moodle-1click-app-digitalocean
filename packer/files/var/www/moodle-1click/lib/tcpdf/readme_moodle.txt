* deleted cache/ doc/ examples/ config/tcpdf_config_alt.php config/lang/ images/
* removed all fonts but the core ones (courier.php, helveticabi.php,
    helveticab.php, helveticai.php, helvetica.php, symbol.php, timesbi.php,
    timesb.php, timesi.php, times.php, zapfdingbats.php) and FreeFont

    be downloadable from moodle.org via new UI
* removed font/utils/
* moving configuration to the lib/pdflib.php wrapper so we do not need to modify

Upgrade to tcpdf_php5 TCPDF 4.0.015 (MDL-15055)
by David Mudrak <david.mudrak@gmail.com>

* deleted cache/ doc/ examples/
* modified config/tcpdf_config.php
    Default values for K_PATH_MAIN and K_PATH_URL are automatically set for
    the Moodle installation. K_PATH_CACHE set to Moodle datadir cache.
    K_PATH_URL_CACHE can't be mapped in Moodle as datadir should not be
    accessible directly. However, it doesn't seem to be used within the
    library code.
